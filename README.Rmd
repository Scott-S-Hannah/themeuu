The goal of themeuu is to provide a easy

## Installation

themeuu can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Scott-S-Hannah/themeuu")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(themeuu)
## basic example code
themeuu::ulster_palettes
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_color_ulster(discrete = TRUE, palette = "main_1") +
  theme_light()

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_color_ulster(discrete = TRUE, palette = "main_2") +
  theme_light()
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
